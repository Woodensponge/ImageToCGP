# ImageToCGP
 Converts images to .cgp files used for Cyber Grind patterns in the game ULTRAKILL, made by Woodensponge.
 ## Using ImageToCGP
 Right now, ImageToCGP is a console application, meaning you have to give the program arguments for it to do what you want. A GUI is planned for the program, but is not a big priority.
 ### How do I use it?
 1. Go to the folder where the executable is located.
 
 1. (Optional) If you don't know how to copy the file path of your image, you should copy the image itself next to the executable.
 
 1. Click on the search bar above the files and type in `cmd`. A console should open up.
 
 1. If you simply want to convert an image into a .cgp file, then you can simply type `ImageToCGP [insert image name here]`.
 
 1. If you copied the image over to the folder, when in the middle of typing the image, you can press tab to autocomplete the image name. If it says `[ImageName].cgp`, press tab again and it should give you the image.
 
 1. After you got the arguments set up, press enter.
 (If you get information on how to use the application, it means you messed up the command. The program should tell you what you did wrong right about the info.)
 
 1. If the program ran successfully (You should see the words `CGP successfully written/created!` right above where you type in the console), copy and paste the .cgp file to ULTRAKILL\CyberGrind\Patterns\.
 
 Please note that enemies are not placed when converting the image to a .cgp file. You can place them yourself by going to https://cyber.pitr.dev/, pressing load file, and opening the .cgp file.
